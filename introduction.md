# Welcome to the Pez Docs Repository

This repository contains documentation for my homelab setup, which spans numerous servers around the world.

## Components

The components of my homelab setup are documented in the subfolder "components". Each component has its own folder which contains why I've chosen to use it and how I'm using it.

## Locations

My homelab setup spans two locations: London and Copenhagen. Each location has its own set of servers, which are documented in the "locations" folder.
