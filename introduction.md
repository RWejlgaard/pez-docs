# Welcome to the Pez Docs Repository

This repository contains documentation for my homelab setup, which spans numerous servers around the world.

## Principles

My thought process and how different components of my homelab is setup are documented in the subfolder "principles". Each component has its own folder which contains why I've chosen to use it and how I'm using it.

## Workloads

All this thought and hardware has to run something for it to make sense. It would be ridiculous to only use it only to host a static webpage.

Details on what I'm actually running and what I use it for can be found under the subfolder "workloads".

## Locations

My homelab setup spans two locations: London and Copenhagen. Each location has its own set of servers, which are documented in the "locations" folder.
