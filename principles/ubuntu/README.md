# Ubuntu

## History

The path to choosing Ubuntu as my primary OS was a long journey.

First, I was running Proxmox but that was kind of a mess to configure and the overhead of virtualizing everything was surprisingly high.

Then, I moved on to Alpine Linux. This was quite good, very memory efficient and no extra processes. However, I ran into issues when I started setting up Ansible.

So I chose the most generic OS I could think of, Ubuntu.
